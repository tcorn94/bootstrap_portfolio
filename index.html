                        <p>I was born in South Florida, but I have lived in a few different places throughout my life. I lived in Vancouver, WA for a year, and Nerima, a prefecture in Tokyo, Japan. I have studied a lot of things, but my major in college was Spanish literature and linguistics. 
                        I'm  <em> almost </em> a certified veterinary assistant, and I'm <em> almost </em> a state certified teacher.
                        I've been a tutor, a teacher, and for the last two years I've been delivering pizzas. My main interest is traveling, and I've visited more than 15 countries so far. There is still so much I'd love to see.
                        From a coding perspective, I'm interested in creating an audio sharing platform for a niche pop culture community, but the main idea is to increase accessibility for the visually impaired to fan created works .</p>

                        My past experience has given me a strong command of grammar and language, which is applicable in front-end web design, such as offering multi-language functionality on a webpage. My history of educational employment has equipped me with confident leadership skills, 
                        and a knack for clear communication with team members. UCF’s coding course put me through a rigorous hands-on application of programming skills, and teamwork. This real-world experience in cooperation is invaluable for programmers, who frequently work on projects with colleagues. Organization and constructive 
                        feedback are key factors in the realms of both technology and education. All of these attributes help make me a strong team player who is not only capable of  performing on my end of the project, but also collaborating with coworkers both professionally and efficiently.
